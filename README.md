For a ridiculously cool look at binary coding reinvented, give this a peep. It's you, math and strings :)

Looking for other languages to be done this way. Just add a pull request!


In the case of the command:

$x->mathParse($x->fn_x\[1], $x->vars);

With the equation here at fn_x\[1]:

# {x5} {c011001,0} - {x2} +  {x3} + 5 + {x1}

with the array:

# \["{x2} + {x6}", 22, "{x1} + 3", 30, \[10, 11, -2], 4, 5, "101010"]

will output this:

# -28

Just use your imagination and the criteria to come up with the answer you require!
